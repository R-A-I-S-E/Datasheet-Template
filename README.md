# Datasheet-Template
The "Datasheets for Datasets" initiative enhances AI dataset transparency. It provides detailed documentation on collection methods, sources, and pre-processing to improve data quality and address biases. A customized datasheet template for audio AI, inspired by Timnit Gebru and developed by Aubrey Beard, promotes transparency and comparability.
