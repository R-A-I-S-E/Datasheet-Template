# Datasheet-Template
Datasheets have been introduced to enhance transparency and accountability in AI by providing detailed information about datasets, including collection methods, sources, pre-processing, and metadata. Aimed at developers, evaluators, and reviewers, these datasheets strive to improve dataset quality, identify biases, and address ethical issues, despite challenges in balancing detail and privacy. A standardized approach and exemplary templates guide the creation of customized datasheets for specific datasets.
